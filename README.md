Classic Arcade Game Emulator Project
===============================

#Description
This repo is the result of my participation in the Udacity Frontend Web Development Nanodegree course.<br> 
It uses object oriented JavaScript to create a Frogger like game. 

#How to Play
###Winning
The player (CatGirl) starts in the bottom center, and must navigate to the "water" in the top of the player field.<br> 
Once the player reaches the water, you will see the alert `w00t, you win!`. Good for you

###Moving
Use the arrow keys to move the player around the board. 

###About those bugs...
Just as in all dev projects, **bugs are bad**, avoid them! Hitting a bug will kill the player.<br> 
If killed, you'll see `Oh noes, you've died!` and the player will go back to the starting position.

#Running the Game 
Copy or clone this repo to your desired destination. Then open `index.html` in your favorite<br>
browser, and play away! 

###`app.js`
This file controls the interaction of the players, enemies, and users. 

###`engine.js`
This file provides the game loop and other assets to get the game going. 

###`resources.js`
Just an image loading utility. Nothing to see here, folks. 

###`images` Folder
If you feel like chosing a different player or enemey, they live here. 

###`css` Folder
`style.css` just holds basic CSS for the `body`, `h1`, and `p` elements. 

###`index.html`
The game! Clone or copy this game to your desired folder, then use this file to open<br>
and play the game.
